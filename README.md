# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

This is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone. This project focuses on developing a command-line interpreter (CLI) that allows users to manage objects representing AirBnB properties (such as Users, Places, States, Cities, and more).

The console is used to manage the backend of the web application by performing operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting instances of various classes.

## Command Interpreter Description

The console is a simple Python command-line interpreter built using the `cmd` module. It allows users to manipulate and persist data in a storage system (`file.json`) using custom shell-like commands.

### How to Start It

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Christia3/alu-AirBnB_clone.git
   cd alu-AirBnB_clone
